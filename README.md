## Forms

The Odin Project's Forms lesson. 

A practice project in making Forms w/ Form Validation + basic UX.
This particular log-in form collects Email, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields.

Functionality:
1. Includes basic HTML and CSS for Forms. Includes the use of `<labels>` for better readability.
2. JS that checks the validity of submitted form values.
3. JS returns error messages if form values didn't meet the required format of each field values. 

What I learned:

1. Learned a bit about client-side form validation and how to implement those with 
* Built-in form validation via HTML
* The manual, but more customizable Javascript validation.

2. More in-depth form styling.
